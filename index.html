     <ul> <li>Try to insolate your house so that you dont have to use your AC much (the AC makes methane which isnt great for the invironment).</li>
          <li>Try to recycle as much as you can, also try to compost. compost is better for the invironment beacause your compost will turn into dirt and then you can use your dirt as fertilizer to plant plants.</li>
          <li>Plant as many trees as you can, trees can turn carbon-doxide into oxygen, we can breathe oxygen but carbon is poisonus to us humans. so when the trees breahte, they help us breathe.</li>
          <li>If you can, try to get solar pannels for your house, solar power is a renewable source of energy that is powerful.(renewable energy is good).</li>
          <li>Try to use renewable energy. Renewable energys are water power, solar power (which you alreaady know about), and wind power. wind power is ine of the strongest sources of power, there are some wind turbines in the ocean  
              where if it rotates once, it can power a whole house for a day.</li>
          <li>Protest to our leaders. if enough of us get together and protest infront of our city halls, the leaders might change things up a little bit and help out our good ol' earth.</li>
          <li>Actually belive in global warming and climate change. The more people belive, the more people help.</li>
          <li>Change your car. Try to change to either an eletric, hybrid or a fuel efficent car.</li> </ul>
          <h1>Now a little D.I.Y...</h1>
	  <p>You will need all of your plastic shopping bags, a wooden spoon with a small handle, and a soda bottle or any other plastic bottle that is over 1 liter. Put the plastic bottle in you'r lap and get a steady hold on it.
             Next you will get multiple plastic bags and stick them into the bottle with the wooden spoon. Repeat the process until you either run out of plastic bags or the bottles are filled. This is a good 
             way to insulate your house.</p>
